jqm-intro
=========

600 seconds of jQueryMobile.

This is an introduction to the jQueryMobile framework for a presentation given on
March 28th, 2013 to the Bellingham Software Developers Network.

This is supposed to be a little bit like a [quine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29)
in that the presentation is written in code.
